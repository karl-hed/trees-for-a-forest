 In 1990, the creation of the association in France and Canada goes hand in hand with the internationalization of the Earth Day movement. The Jour de la Terre France association has distinguished itself by organizing environmental campaigns and rallies, one of which, on April 22, 1990, remains to this day the largest French event dedicated to the environment with millions participants and nearly a thousand actions in all areas of the environment. In Quebec, Earth Day has been celebrated since 1995 by organizing all kinds of activities to raise awareness of environmental issues. With its ability to mobilize community players, the provincial organization has continued to grow, developing numerous action programs on April 22 and every day.
 In 2015, French and Quebec teams joined forces to breathe new life into the Earth Day movement in France, Quebec and the rest of the Francophonie. In 2019, a strategic alliance was concluded with EarthPLAY in Canada, so that the environmental support programs carried out in Quebec can be heard everywhere on Canadian territory.
