 about_us:"Our mission: To help people and organizations reduce their impact on the environment. Earth Day was first celebrated on April 22, 1970. Today, more than one billion people in 193 countries take action each year for Earth Day. Over the years, Earth Day has become the largest participatory environmental movement on the planet.
 In 1990, the creation of the association in France and Canada goes hand in hand with the internationalization of the Earth Day movement. The Jour de la Terre France association has distinguished itself by organizing environmental campaigns and rallies, one of which, on April 22, 1990, remains to this day the largest French event dedicated to the environment with millions participants and nearly a thousand actions in all areas of the environment. In Quebec, Earth Day has been celebrated since 1995 by organizing all kinds of activities to raise awareness of environmental issues. With its ability to mobilize community players, the provincial organization has continued to grow, developing numerous action programs on April 22 and every day.
 In 2015, French and Quebec teams joined forces to breathe new life into the Earth Day movement in France, Quebec and the rest of the Francophonie. In 2019, a strategic alliance was concluded with EarthPLAY in Canada, so that the environmental support programs carried out in Quebec can be heard everywhere on Canadian territory. The association Jour de la Terre Canada is the holder of the trademark of the Earth Day in France and Canada"

 about_us:"Far from being a luxury, architecture is essential to human flourishing, sustainable development and the autonomy of communities. It involves rights as fundamental as housing, health, education, equality and security. These depend on adequate infrastructure, which requires quality architecture. Yet, due to hazards and injustices, the majority of the planet's inhabitants live in deficient built environments, and do not benefit from the capacities required to develop safe, healthy and ecological living environments. This situation persists all the more as urbanization, migration and climate change are accelerating, further deteriorating the habitat of vulnerable people. This is why solidarity, quality and borderless architecture is more necessary than ever to find the best solutions to the challenges facing humanity."
