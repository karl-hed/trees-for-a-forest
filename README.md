Trees for a forest is an app to join volunteer tree-planters and businesses that are seeking people willing to participate in a tree-planting event.
It is an app developped for our 12-week coding bootcamp at [Le Wagon coding bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com) in Montreal.

The web app is hosted here: www.trees-for-a-forest.me
